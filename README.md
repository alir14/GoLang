# GoLang
Go Lang, Such a beautiful language.

Personally, I am interested in low level languages like C++. However, I did not have a chance to work on too many projects with such a language since the need of job market is more tend to Web applications. I have worked in many web projects and used different technologies such as.Net MVC, PHP, HHVM, NodeJS and etc, but I never satisfied with those technologies until I started to look at GoLang.
A powerful, simple and fast language that has C++ features and gives ability to have concurrent functionality.

•	First of all, it lets you have pointer and the code translated directly to machine language like C++.
•	Second, it is simple. Nice and easy syntax with basic datatypes that help you build a fantastic service. If you have worked with either Python, NodeJs or C++ you would learn it so fast. But if you do not then Do not worry, it is simple just try it.
•	Third, concurrency. Do not make mistake, it is not parallel but in a single thread you can have concurrent methods which make a service fast.

I have done a developed small project with it in this repo. I have not used any Database package in it but I am going to do that.
It is just some basic functionality to get familiar with the language structure like Struct, variables, pointers and how to associate and use them.
